# Team Profile Generator


## About the Project

My objective is to demonstrate my object oriented programming skills.  I am building a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

* This application is not yet complete. 

## User Story
